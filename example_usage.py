            To obtain theoretically proven error, either one of two conditions
            must be met:
                1. Smoothed coreset (with duplicated data points) is used with
                   the original DecisionTree model. Any existing model, such as
                   DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn, or LGBRegressor from
                   LightGBM, can be used without modifying its cost function.
                2. Original coreset is used, but the DecisionTree model is
                   modified to work with the Fitting-Loss algorithm as the
                   cost function, as described in the supplementary materials
                   of the paper. In this case, any model such as
                   DecisionTreeRegressor or LightGBM regressor can be used,
                   but the class must be modified to work with an updated
                   Fitting-Loss cost function.
            Because we do not modify the sklearn's DecisionTreeRegressor class,
            smoothed coreset must be used to obtain better results. However,
            in practice the original coreset also obtains good approximation
            for smaller values of epsilon.
